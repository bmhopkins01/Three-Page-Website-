        Savannah is my hometown and one of my favorite cities. I loved growing up on the coast and being so close to the water. The trees and spanish moss are so beautiful and unique. Like London, there is so much rich history to be explored. The food scene is great and getting even better! Savannah has grown a lot in its progressivism and is a fantastic place to live. I didn't really appreciate the city until I moved away but it now holds some very special memories. I don't know if I want to live there in the future, but I'm definitely going to visit.
