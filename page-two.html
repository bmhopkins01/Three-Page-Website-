        London is my second favorite city. I visited in 2014 with my family after going to Ireland to see my grandparents. London was really col and snowy but so much fun. I had some of the best food there including Thai, Arabic, and tons of tea. The architecture was absolutely stunning with so much history. I loved riding the tube and people-watching; everyone dressed so nicely, especially in the financial district. I would love to go back one day and explore more of the city when I have the time and money.
